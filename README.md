# Phitter Distributions Files

Welcome to the Phitter Distributions Files repository! This repository contains a collection of Excel files detailing various probability distributions, both continuous and discrete.


## Contents

1. **Continuous Distributions**: This folder contains Excel files representing different continuous probability distributions. Each file provides details, charts, and possible use-cases for the specific distribution it represents.

2. **Discrete Distributions**: This folder contains Excel files representing various discrete probability distributions. Each file similarly offers an in-depth understanding of its respective distribution.

## File Descriptions

1. **Random Generation Sheet**
   - **Sample Generation**: Produces a random sample based on the distribution.
   - **Inverse Function**: Computes the value based on the inverse function of the distribution.
   - **Parameter Description**: Describes the parameters used in the distribution.
   - **Parametric Mean Calculation**: Computes the mean of the distribution based on the parameters.
   - **Histogram**: Provides a histogram visualization of the generated sample.

2. **PDF/PMF Sheet**
   - **Density/Mass Function**: Shows the Probability Density Function (for continuous distributions) or Probability Mass Function (for discrete distributions) of the distribution.

3. **CDF Sheet**
   - **Cumulative Function**: Displays the Cumulative Distribution Function of the given distribution.
   - **Empirical Function**: Represents the empirical distribution based on a given sample.

4. **QQ  Sheet**
   - **QQ Plot**: Contains a QQ (Quantile-Quantile) plot which compares the sample quantiles with theoretical quantiles of the distribution.

## Requirements

- Please note that the Excel files in this repository are optimized for **Excel 365**. To ensure proper compatibility and functionality, please open these files in Excel 365 only.
